The following project is an overcurrent relay. Overcurrent relays mainly used to isolate a load circuit when faulty conditions are detected. The current market is filled with induction disc which suffer from the typical problems experienced y mechanical systems. This project aims to replace the induction disk with a programmed microcontroller. This microcontroller will make trip decisions and offers the flexibility of being reprogrammed. it also offers the user the ability to varry the trip conditions. An IOT feature is enabled in this project where ESP32 board is used to connect to the wifi and log the transmission line data onto a web dadashboard. An additional feature is the Whatsapp API which sends data to the defined user when the faulty condition occurs and when the relay trips. Follow all the files for a clearer understanding.
